2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    While working on the Memory Game website, I attempted to make the pattern that the game is played in randomly generated, but I ran into a lot of issues doing this. I am definitely committed to finishing this feature of the website after I submit a working project. I believe I created the random generator function correctly, I was just missing a crucial call to it somewhere in the javascript file. To overcome this issue in the program, I will rewrite the function over again and look at all the connecting functions that take part in playing the sequence of buttons. I had never worked with CSS, JavaScript, or HTML before so that part of this project was new to me. I have learned through college and doing this pre-work project to not be afraid of new languages. The step by step guide and the helpful information about Glitch helped me through these unfamiliarities. During the submission I had difficulty pushing my project to my repository successfully after watching the video provided (walkthrough video on exporting Glitch to GitHub). I was having a hard time finding where the import and export settings were in Glitch. Then, I looked back at the Prework document and found there was a link to step by step instructions about how to export any project you make on glitch to your repository. I found this link extremely helpful. I have found that it is important to accept failure and struggle because during the time of failure or struggle is when I learn the most.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    While working while Glitch, as much as I enjoyed this tool/ framework, I kept wondering about creating a website from scratch. How long would this take a beginner like myself to complete? I understand this is not the most popular choice to web developers when frameworks can save time, but I am interested in what makes up that framework. To take my interests even further, I was wondering about how secure the website I created is. I’m extremely interested in cybersecurity and networks, and I’d like to learn more about what makes a website secure or not secure further than knowing it has a Secure Sockets Layer certificate. What does this certificate justify and mean? In general I would like to establish a good set of skills with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS and learn what is behind the scenes of a Glitch Framework. When I am working with code, oftentimes I wonder about how many other people are coding similar software, and what that software is applied to in different instances. I’d like to learn more about the demand for web developers and specific careers in web development. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    If I had a few more hours, I'd like to add additional buttons but make them different shapes instead of squares. I mentioned in the second question that I was working on implementing a random number generator but I couldn't quite figure it out. If I had had more time I could have found my bug, but I plan to complete implementing the random pattern generator as soon as possible. If I had a few more hours, I would have figured out how to implement a multiple page website. More specifically, when a user wins or loses, they are brought to a different page with either congratulating animations (they won) or sad animations (they lost). Another feature that I would have added to the game was moving pictures or subject specific pictures inside of each button instead of still pictures. This feature would have made the game more interesting and fun. Eventually I would like to speed up the game to make it a little more difficult and give the player strikes but only if they are close to the end of the sequence.
